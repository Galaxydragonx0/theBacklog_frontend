# ARE YOU FEDUP OF LOSING TRACK OF TITLES YOU WANT TO WATCH/READ/PLAY ???? 

Well so was I. The project intially was born from me having too much tabs open to keep track of my titles. Who even does that in the first place ???
Apparently, I wanted to so I could preserve my precious RAM. So yes you can keep a list Movies, Shows, Games and Books you want to WATCH/READ/PLAY.
Hope you have some fun with it
