# The Backlog
I was annoyed that I couldn't find a site that you can keep all entertainment titles (movies, shows, games and books) in one place, so I made one. I am still figuring out on how to build the project properly as I am getting errors but the site works when running in development mode. So, how do you do that for the time being ??? Just continue reading ...


## Running the development app

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## That's all for now 

Nothing to much to add to this for now but I hope you enjoy the app and design for now it was tiring process to design but lovely to see come together
